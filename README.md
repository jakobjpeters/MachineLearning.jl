## About

This project contains machine learning algorithms (currently only a neural network, but with more to come) written from scratch. It is intended for learning purposes; I do not expect it to be a viable package.

## Why Julia?

Julia is my favorite programming language for many reasons, but I think that its appeal is best stated by the founders [here](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/).


## Instructions

Run an example script directly or create your own script using this project as a package. Using an 'EMNIST' dataset for the first time will download the datasets into the parent directory, which take several minutes. If you run into problems, stop the program, delete the 'emnist' folder, and start again.

Example scripts:
- neural_network.jl
    - Feed-forward multilayer perceptron
    - Run with command line arguments
        - ["concise", "verbose", "pretrained"]
- regression.jl
    - Simple linear regression

Note: Julia is JAOT (just ahead of time) compiled, meaning that 1) the initial compilation of packages will take a few seconds and 2) each method call with new argument types will take time to compile specialized code for those types. After this occurs, Julia will run quite swiftly.
